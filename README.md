# StripeSetEnvironment

This repo is based on this tutorial - https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/development-environment?lang=dotnet. 
Idea of this repo is that it should reduce your time by the fact that code is ready for you can just clone repo and run it. All you need to do is to set your environment e.g. Stripe CLI, Stripe account etc.
