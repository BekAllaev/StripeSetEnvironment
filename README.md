This repo is based on this tutorial - https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/development-environment?lang=dotnet. 
Idea of this repo is that it should reduce your time by the fact that code is ready for you can just clone repo and run it. All you need to do is to set your environment e.g. Stripe CLI, Stripe account etc. 

***Complete Setup-cli part only!!! Code from this tutorial is ready for you.***

So just complete this steps - https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/development-environment?lang=dotnet#setup-cli. Then download my repo and run it in VS code or in VS(there is `.sln` file in repo)
